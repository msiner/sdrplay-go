# sdrplay-go

sdrplay-go is a Go programming language wrapper of the SDRplay API that can be
used to access SDRplay RSP receivers. It implements direct access to the C API
as well as a higher-level declarative API that takes advantage of features in
the Go programming language. On Windows, Cgo is not required.

## Build Configuration

### Linux
On Linux, building sdrplay-go applications requires Go, the SDRplay API, and
a Cgo-compatible C compiler. The Go environment must be configured with CGO_ENABLED=1.

### Windows
On Windows, building sdrplay-go applications requires Go and the SDRplay API.
If CGO_ENABLED=0, sdrplay-go defaults to using runtime DLL loading instead of
typical dynamic linking. This allows sdrplay-go applications to be compiled without
using Cgo or requiring a C compiler.

If CGO_ENABLED=1, sdrplay-go will build using Cgo and typical dynamic linking. To
build with runtime DLL loading while keeping CGO_ENABLED=1, declare the "dll" tag
during build (e.g. ```go build -tags dll ./...```).

## Quickstart

This section describes how to create a new Go application that uses
sdrplay-go.

1. Create a new directory for you application and initialize it as
a Go module.
```sh
mkdir sdrapp
cd sdrapp
go mod init local/sdrapp
```

2. Create and open new file at ```./main.go```

3. Add the following Go code to the file. This main function will
select and configure a single RSP device, receive a single callback
of samples, and then exit. 
```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"log"

	"github.com/msiner/sdrplay-go/api"
	"github.com/msiner/sdrplay-go/session"
)

func main() {
	ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
	defer cancel()
	err := session.Run(
		ctx,
		session.WithSelector(
			session.WithDuoModeSingle(),
			session.WithDuoTunerEither(),
		),
		session.WithDeviceConfig(
			session.WithSingleChannelConfig(
				session.WithTuneFreq(1e9),
				session.WithAGC(api.AGC_CTRL_EN, -20),
			),
		),
		session.WithStreamACallback(
			func(xi, xq []int16, params *api.StreamCbParamsT, reset bool) {
				select {
				case <-ctx.Done():
				default:
					log.Printf("Got %d samples\n", params.NumSamples)
					cancel()
				}
			},
		),
	)
	if err != nil {
		log.Println(err)
	}
}
```

4. Compile and run the new application.
```sh
go run ./main.go
```
```
2021/06/07 20:51:20 Run
2021/06/07 20:51:21 Got 1008 samples
2021/06/07 20:51:22 context canceled
```

## Utilities

This module also provides some command-line utilities in the cmd package.
These utilities are designed to be useful tools on their own as well as
examples of how to use the module.

1. rspdetect
The rspdetect command simply opens the API, requests a list of available
devices, and then prints the information for each device.
2. rspwav
The rspwav command opens an available RSP device and configures a single
stream. Samples are recorded to a stereo WAV file where the I component
is left and the Q component is right.
3. rspudp
The rspudp command opens an available RSP device and configures a single
stream. Samples are packetized into UDP payloads and sent to the configured
destination address and port. It also supports an optional 64-bit packet
counter at the start of each payload. Sample components are interleaved
(e.g. I1,Q1,I2,Q2,...,IN,QN).
4. duowav
The duowav command is similar to rspwav, but it uses an RSPduo device
configured in dual-tune mode with both tuners configured identically.
Components and samples are interleaved
(e.g. I1a,Q1a,I1b,Q1b,...,INa,QNa,INb,QNb). In the WAV multi-channel
audo context, this maps to Ia, Qa, Ib, and Qb as front-left, front-right,
front-center, and low-frequency respectively.
5. duoudp
The duoudp command is similar to rspudp, but it uses and RSPduo device
configured in dual-tuner mode with both tuners configured identically.
Components and samples are interleaved
(e.g. I1a,Q1a,I1b,Q1b,...,INa,QNa,INb,QNb).
6. duocorr
The duocorr command is a rudimentary tool included for testing purposes.
It uses an RSPduo device configured in dual-tuner mode with both tuners
configured identically. For a specified duration, it calculates a
cross-correlation peak offset between channel A and channel B using the
magnitude of the samples.
